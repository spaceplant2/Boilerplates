# OSQueries
### **My Personal Library**  
I've looked at a lot of stuff written for OSQuery, and it all feels like it was created by theroists without any practical testing, or on the fly for a narrow use-case. So I thought I'd add my own voice to the caucopohony. Thanks to [Sophos](https://github.com/SophosRapidResponse/OSQuery/tree/main) for the massive library they already have.

Happy Hunting!!!
