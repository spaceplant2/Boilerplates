# Welcome to my stash of randomness

I love to play with computers and code! Automation and orchestration are my particular focus, but I have always had a thing for cryptography and security. So here you will find all sorts of snippets that I have created. Most everything here will be notated to make amelioration easier, so have fun making from it what you will.

# Notable Items

- I just added the folder PsProgramInstall. This is my stopgap solution for not having a viable option for windows imaging in a production environment. All functions are cmdlet style with help available, with a single file to launch the whole process.

- Just dropped a script in ForensicExam. This will require SysInternals to be added to the folder, and will then create text files of the output from several utilities. **Recommended to run as admin**. Also added a feature to create hashes of a file and a zip archive for sandbox or other analysis.
