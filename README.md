# Welcome to my stash of randomness

I love to play with computers and code! Automation and orchestration are my particular focus, but I have always had a thing for cryptography and security. So here you will find all sorts of snippets that I have created. Most everything here will be notated to make ameleoration easier, so have fun making from it what you will.

# Notable Items

I just added the folder PsProgramInstall. This is my stopgap solution for not having a viable option for windows imaging in a production environment. All functions are cmdlet style with help available, with a single file to launch the whole process.
